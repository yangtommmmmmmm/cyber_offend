This part is mainly discussed about SQL injection attack.

1.Where can we inject our malicious SQL request?
IP--->Port--->Host Header--->Path--->Form

2.Bypass the authentication:
Input below grammar, you could bypass the detection for authentication:
'or 1=1 --//

3.Error-based(In-bound) SQLi:
Input below grammar, you could disclose some sensitive info from the feedback error message:
'or 1=1 in (select @@version)--// #disclose the version of dbms
'or 1=1 in (select password from users)--// #disclose the password from users table

4.Union-based SQLi:
Input below union grammar, you could also disclose some sensitive info.But u need to ensure the count
of column you desire is as same as the count of coulmn the DB table actually has by 'ORDER BY 1--//.
If not identical, u maybe go to the fail:
'UNION SELECT null, username, password, description, null FROM users --//

5.Blind-based SQLi:
Sometimes, as you input SQLi, the DBMS may not feedback to u. So if u would like to check whether attack 
successes or not, u could input below grammar to check:
'AND IF (1=1, sleep(3), 'false') --//
According to above grammar, if your attack successes, the DBMS would go to if loop and sleep for 3 seconds. 
But if your attack fails, the DBMS would feedback fail message to u.
