1.4.How to capture the API_Request file(header/body)?
We could use Burpsuite to capture it.
Step1.Trigger the Burpsuite tool.
Step2.Browse the web form where we could submit our POST request.Then, we use this form to submit our POST request.
Step3.After submitting, Burpsuite could capture our POST request.
Step4.Then, we click 'Copy to file' on this request in Burpsuite to copy it to local file.

Step5.After copying it, we modify this file:
.Original file:
POST / HTTP/1.1
.........
.........
Referer: http://www.abc.com/
.........

.Modified file:
POST http://www.abc.com/ HTTP/1.1
.........
.........
Referer: http://www.abc.com/
.........

Step6.After modifying, we save it and use it to be the value of the parameter 'r' for sqlmap.
