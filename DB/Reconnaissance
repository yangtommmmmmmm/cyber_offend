How to judge the which DBMS services are enabled on the target?
As u have finished scanning, u could get the information about the port that target enable.

If u scan the target, u get below info, then u could infer what DBMS service the target provide:
.MSSQL-1433, IIS Web Struc.
.MySQL-3306/3346, Apache Struc.
.PostgreSQL-5432, Tomcat Struc.

And the structure of DBMS is:
DBMS > DB > Table(Scheme) > Attribute(Column)、Record(Row)

1-4.MySQL [(none)]> SELECT * FROM {table/scheme_name.attribute} WHERE {condition}
