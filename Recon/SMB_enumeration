This part is mainly talking about the enumeration of SMB service.It's a very important section.
1.SMB service:
SMB service, called 'Server Message Block', is for sharing files with each host.
1-1.Windows-TCP 135/139(legacy),TCP 445(modern)
    Linux-TCP 139(legacy),TCP 445(modern)
1-2.SMBv1:plaintext transferring;SMBv2:support for signature(but it didn't work in default way);
SMBv3:support for encrypting
1-3.How to share them? Please check 'Transfer File Techs' section.

2.Enumeration:
2-1.Check which host has SMB service.
.nmap:
.-1.nmap 192.168.0.1-254 -p135,139,445 --open -oG - | grep Up | cut -d' ' -f2 > smb_list
*This result host is maybe Windows or Linux.

.nxc:
.-1.nxc smb smb_list
*Sometimes you need to input your account/password to use this command,so u need to add below parameters:
-u student -p lab
-u student -p lab --local-auth
*According to the result,if the value of 'name' is different from the value of 'domain',we could infer this host is
DC (Domain Controller).

.smbclient:
.-1.for ip in $(cat smb_list); do (echo $ip; echo; smbclient -N -L $ip echo); done
--->In addition to find out which host has SMB service, it could also find out which host alows anonymous login to use SMB service.

2-2.Enumerate the info from the hosts with SMB service:
