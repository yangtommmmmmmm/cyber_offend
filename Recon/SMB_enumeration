This part is mainly talking about the enumeration of SMB service.It's a very important section.
1.SMB service:
SMB service, called 'Server Message Block', is for sharing files with each host.
1-1.Windows-TCP 135/139(legacy),TCP 445(modern)
    Linux-TCP 139(legacy),TCP 445(modern)
1-2.SMBv1:plaintext transferring;SMBv2:digital certificate(but it didn't work in default way);
SMBv3:support for encrypting
1-3.How to share them? Please check 'Transfer File Techs' section.

2.Enumeration:
2-1.Check which host has SMB service.
.nmap:
.-1.nmap 192.168.0.1-254 -p135,139,445 --open -oG - | grep Up | cut -d' ' -f2 > smb_list
*This result host is maybe Windows or Linux.
.nxc:
.-1.nxc smb smb_list
