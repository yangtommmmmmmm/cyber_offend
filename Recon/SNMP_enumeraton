This part is mainly discussed about SNMP service.
As u scans the host,u gets UDP-161,UDP-162,then the host provides SNMP service.

1.SNMP protocol walkthrough:
1-1.The SNMP Server---(request for relevant info from the managed network device by UDP-161)--->The agent of the managed network devices
The agent of the managed network devices receive the request by UDP-162.
1-2.The agent of the managed network devices---(transimit its relevant info and TRAP to the SNMP Server by UDP-161)--->The SNMP Server
The SNMP Server receives the response by UDP-162.
1-3.The agent of the managed network devices will store the relevant info in MIB(The SNMP Management Information Base).Each
information has the corresponding OID.

2.If the SNMP Server and the managed network devices are supported for SNMPv1,v2,user needs to input 'Community-public,private
and manager' to request the info from MIB.However,if the snmp server and the managed network devices are supported for SNMPv3,user needs to
input 'username/password' to request the info from MIB.
Note: If user inputs 'Community Name-public' to request the info from MIB,the respond info is read-only.But if user inputs
'Community-private' to request the info from MIB,the respond info is not only readable but also writeable.

3.Offender sometimes requires the info from MIB to get more detailed info.So,Offender could use below command to fulfill it:
3-1.Check which host has SNMP service:

3-1.Onesixtyone:
onesixtyone {options} {Host/-i Host_file} {Community/-c Community_file}
.The value of Host is for the ipv4 address or ipv4 address range for the managed network devices.
.Host_file contains a list of the ipv4 address of the managed network devices.
.The value of Community is for the MIB tree-community name of the managed network devices.
.Community_file contains a list of the MIB tree-community name of the managed network devices.
.options:
*-o:generate the output file
*-w:define the scanning time

3-2.Snmpwalk:
snmpwalk {options} {the ipv4 address for the agent of the maanged network device} {OID}
.options:
*-v:-v1->version1;-v2c->version2;-v3->version3
*-t:the delay of connection
*-c:the MIB tree name-Community name of the managed network device.Mainly for SNMPv1,SNMPv2.
*-u/-A:the username/password for the managed network devices.Mainly for SNMPv3.
*-oA:Transfer the form of result to ASCII.

3-3.sudo nmap 192.168.220.153 -sU -p 161 --script snmp-win32-users
This command could enumerate the SNMP-service users of the host.
