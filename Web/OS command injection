This section is mainly talking about OS command injection attack.

1.OS command injection Attack flow:
Step1.Find the web page location where u could implement OS command.
Step2.Input the common commands for OS command injection below:
.Linux:
*ls
*mkdir
*id
*cat
*ping

.Windows:
*dir
*md--->setup directory
*id
*type
*ping

.PHP Function:
*system---><?php system('ls'.$_GET['vul']);?>

.Below resource would provide the OS command injection u can use:
https://github.com/payloadbox/command-injection-payload-list

Step3.After input, u could do attack.

2.If u would like to link many command, u could do below:
.;--->Terminate symbol.Ex:ping;ls
.|--->pipe line symbol.It will let the second command use the output of the first command.
.||--->ping || ls, if ping fails, ls would active.
.&&--->ping && ls, if ping fails, ls wouldn't active.

3.When u input os command, u need to notice the escape characteristic.
For example, as u input 1&&whoami, &&whoami will been deemed as an normal characteristic.So,
if u modify to 1"&&whoami", &&whoami will not been deemed as an normal characteristic.

4.If the target is PHP Web Server, we could use "escapeshellarg()" or "escapeshellcmd()" to defend
OS command injection.
