How to judge the which web services are enabled on the target?
As u have finished scanning, u could get the information about the port that target enable.

80/8080:HTTP/Web Service
443:HTTPS/Web Service

Then,if u need to judge whether web is wordpress platform or not, u could follow below command:
$ whatweb <URL>

Next, we could use below tools to enumerate the web path to find the entry easily attacked for us.

1.gobuster:
The parameter for gobuster:
1-1.-u (--url):the specific URL
1-2.-w:specify the dictionary for cracking the web path.
./usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
./usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt
.the file in /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/

*If u would like to use big.txt to crack, u need to add -p pattern. Because the form of 
big.txt is different from any else dictionary files.

*If the dictionary for cracking web path only has 'admin',it will lose the web path file
'admin.php'. So u need to notice it!

1-3.-r:request a redirect URL (301、302) for collecting.
1-4.-f:request a client-issue URL (403、404) for collecting.
1-5.-x:specify the file extension. -x aspx,jsp,php.


2.feroxbuster:
The installation package path:
https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster
The parameter for feroxbuster is almost as same as gobuster. The common feroxbuster command for gathering is below:
$ feroxbuster -n --url <URL>
